## Introduction
The Machinery Management System is a comprehensive web application developed using J2EE and Oracle database technologies. It is designed to monitor and update the statuses of machines within a plant, streamline maintenance operations, and improve overall efficiency. The system offers features such as issue tracking, engineer assignment, administrative management, QR code generation for machine identification, and a voice generator for automated reporting.

## Features
- **Machine Monitoring**: Track and update machine statuses in real-time.
- **Issue Tracking**: Log and track issues related to machines.
- **Engineer Assignment**: Assign engineers to address specific machine issues based on their domain expertise.
- **Administrative Management**: Manage machine data, engineer details, and issue reports.
- **QR Code Generation**: Generate and store QR codes for machine identification.
- **Voice Generator**: Automated voice reporting for machine statuses and issues.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- **Backend**: Java, J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition)
- **Database**: Oracle Database
- **Server**: Apache Tomcat
- **Tools**: NetBeans IDE, JDBC, JNDI

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machinery-management-system.git
   cd machinery-management-system
   ```

2. **Setup Database**:
   - Install Oracle Database.
   - Create a database schema using the provided SQL scripts in the `database` directory.

3. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - Update the database connection settings in the `context.xml` file located in the `WEB-INF` directory.

4. **Build and Deploy**:
   - Open the project in NetBeans IDE.
   - Build the project.
   - Deploy the project to the Apache Tomcat server.

## Usage
1. **Login**:
   - Access the login page at `http://localhost:8080/machinery-management-system/login.jsp`.
   - Enter your credentials to log in.

2. **Dashboard**:
   - After a successful login, you will be redirected to the dashboard.
   - Use the sidebar to navigate between different sections such as machines, details, and complaints.

3. **Manage Machines**:
   - View, add, edit, and delete machine entries.
   - Generate QR codes for new machines.

4. **Track Issues**:
   - Log new issues and track existing ones.
   - Assign issues to engineers.

5. **Automated Reporting**:
   - Use the voice generator feature for automated reporting of machine statuses and issues.

## Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_machine (
    id NUMBER(4) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100),
    model VARCHAR2(100),
    description VARCHAR2(255)
);

CREATE TABLE issues (
    id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    machine_id NUMBER,
    description VARCHAR2(255),
    status VARCHAR2(50),
    assigned_engineer VARCHAR2(100),
    FOREIGN KEY (machine_id) REFERENCES user_machine(id)
);

CREATE TABLE engineers (
    id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100),
    domain VARCHAR2(100)
);
```

## Future Enhancements
- Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
- Add machine maintenance history tracking.
- Integrate with external APIs for advanced analytics.
- Develop a mobile app version of the system.
